Changes in this version include:

  New Features:

o Added the estimation optimization, geometry and ode package from the 
  Mantissa library. 

  Fixed bugs:

o Fixed numerous warnings in test code. 
o Use the initial guess provided by the user in BrentSolver.solve(), thus 
  improving speed. Issue: MATH-156. Thanks to Tyler Ward. 
o Made ComplexFormat format double values with a provided NumberFormat 
  instance instead of using the real part format for all values. Issue: 
  MATH-18. Thanks to Phil Steitz. 
o Modified ProperFractionFormat to reject embedded minus signs. Issue: 
  MATH-60. Thanks to Nhung Nnguyen. 
o Added a nextAfter method in MathUtils to return the next 
  machine-representable number in a specified direction from a given floating 
  point number. Used this to ensure that MathUtils.round does not return 
  incorrect results for numbers with bad IEEE754 representations. Issue: 
  MATH-151. Thanks to Luc Maisonobe. 
o Modified getSumSquaredErrors method in SimpleRegression to always return a 
  non-negative result. Issue: MATH-85. Thanks to Mark Osborn, Luc Maisonobe. 
o Corrected nextInt and nextLong to handle wide value ranges. Issue: 
  MATH-153. Thanks to Remi Arntzen. 
o Increased default precision of Gamma and Beta functions. Issue: MATH-166. 
  Thanks to Lukas Theussl. 
o Modified NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbablity to catch 
  MaxIterationsExceededException and return 0 or 1, resp. if the argument is 
  more than 20 standard deviations from the mean. Issue: MATH-167. 

  Changes:

o Added Pascal distribution implementation. Issue: MATH-120. Thanks to Todd 
  C. Parnell. 
o Added QR Decomposition. Issue: MATH-148. Thanks to Joni Salonen. 
o Added Fast Fourier Transform implementation. Issue: MATH-140. Thanks to 
  Xiaogang Zhang. 
o Added log function to MathUtils. Issue: MATH-158. Thanks to Hasan Diwan. 
o Added two sample (binned comparison) ChiSquare test. Issue: MATH-160. 
  Thanks to Matthias Hummel.
